## User Interface

### Quick Access Toolbar - Home Page

![QuickAccessToolbar](./docs/qat.png)

If we have defined scripts on the home page, then we can "quick execute them" them there by clicking them. 

### Scripts

![Scripts Page](./docs/scripts.png)

We can declare and save pre-defined scripts that will run on the current open tab via **keyup** events or the **Quick Access Toolbar**

![Editor Page](./docs/editor.png)

Editing scripts is possible using the internal _limited_ Javascript editor that is available with the **Edit** button.
